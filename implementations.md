# [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
Blender is an open-source 3D animation program with several visual programming tools.

<br>

![](assets/blender-node-editor.png)

The [node editor](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/node_editor/introduction.html) allows you to create materials (shaders), texture maps, and compositing flows. They're also used for [rendering](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/cycles/nodes/introduction.html).

<br>

![](assets/blender-logic-editor.png)

The [logic editor](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/logic_editor.html) is used to set up game logic for Blender's built-in game engine. The interface seems like a slightly different take on patching, with a 3-step `sensor > controller > actuator` layout.

by [Dan Ingalls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Ingalls), Scott Wallace, Yu-Ying Chow, Frank Ludolph, and Ken Doyle at the [Apple ATG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Advanced_Technology_Group)

An interesting and fairly early visual language, built in Smalltalk by one of Smalltalk's creators. Also interesting to consider that this work was being done coincidently with HyperCard at Apple.

> Fabrik is a visual programming environment — a kit of computational and user-interface components that can be "wired" together to build new components and useful applications. Fabrik diagrams utilize bidirectional dataflow connections as a shorthand for multiple paths of flow. Built on object-oriented foundations, Fabrik components can compute arbitrary objects as outputs. Music and animation can be programmed in this way and the user interface can even be extended by generating graphical structures that depend on other data. An interactive type system guards against meaningless connections. As with simple dataflow, each Fabrik component can be compiled into an object with access methods corresponding to each of the possible paths of data propagation.

# [Full Metal Jacket](http://www.fmjlang.co.uk/fmj/FMJ.html)
by Donald Fisk

There are some interesting ideas about state and control flow in this one. It's the product of a formal academic process, being written up in a few papers, so there's definitely more thought put into it than might appear judging just by the visual design. It's also newer than you might think — circa 2015.

> Iteration uses two special linked vertices called start+ and repeat+. The start+ vertex has an equal number of inputs and outputs. When a value is received on every input of start+, each value is output on the corresponding output. The repeat+ vertex has the same number of inputs as start+, each of which has the same type. An edge connected to an input on repeat+ really sends its values to the corresponding input on start+.

![](assets/orca.jpg)

# [ORCΛ](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#orca)
by [Devine Lu Linvega](https://xxiivv.com)

> Orca is a visual programming playground. Orca is an esoteric programming language, designed to create procedural sequencers. Each letter of the alphabet is an operation, uppercase letters operate each frame, lowercase letters operate on bang.

If you haven't seen it in action, you might think that Orca doesn't really qualify as a visual language. Well, Orca uses text the same way classic roguelike games do — think ADOM or Dwarf Fortress. Each letter of the alphabet represents a function, with inputs on either side and output coming out the bottom. You pass data between functions by arranging them spatially on the grid. Your state is visible as numbers and letters on the grid, too. The fact that letters are used to represent both functions and data means there's a decent amount of metaprogramming easily within reach. In fact, Orca sits at an interesting space between "programming language" and "music sequencer", making the programming experience feel a lot like improvising and exploring on a musical instrument. Very cool.

Orca doesn't generate any sound on its own. It's not even a tool for music until you hook it up to (eg) a synthesizer. But you could also hook it up to something else, like a game engine, and use it to drive game logic or graphics.

* [Example 1](https://twitter.com/neauoire/status/1135510882807500800)
* [Example 2](https://twitter.com/neauoire/status/1149853206018584576)
* [ORCA Sequencer Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaI_TuISSJE&t=839) — This is a nice introductory tutorial. I've linked to a spot in the video that should give you a taste of the spatial nature of Orca.

I wonder what would happen if someone fed the output of a cellular automaton into Orca, or used it as part of a roguelike.

> Rete is a modular framework for visual programming. Rete allows you to create node-based editor directly in the browser. You can define nodes and workers that allow users to create instructions for processing data in your editor without a single line of code.

This project seems pretty rough, but it's surprisingly popular. There might be something to it that wasn't immediately obvious to me in my initial quick kick of the tires.

> Flexible, super charged, batch image processing for your Mac. A node based batch image processor means you can mix, match, and combine different operations together to make the perfect workflow. A node for every operation, from changing DPI to rotation to Machine Learning to custom behaviors with AppleScript. Optimize your images for fast delivery over the Internet.

# [Scratch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language))

A VPL designed mainly for children. Scratch is a text-centric language that you assemble using blocks that snap together, with the syntax rules enforced by the shape of the blocks. Color is used to indicate a block's type of data or behaviour.

By [Toby Schachman](https://twitter.com/mandy3284)

> Shadershop is an interface for programming GPU shaders in the mode of a direct manipulation image editor like Photoshop. It is an experiment in leveraging the programmer's spatial reasoning the way that coding today leverages the programmer's symbolic reasoning.

A rough prototype that looks modern but doesn't seem particularly fleshed-out. One nice feature is the way nodes are created using the Apple Pencil, which you can see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNWC_OF5Q-Y).

by [Scott Kim](http://www.scottkim.com)

> It struck me as odd, and deeply wrong, that we were building tools for visual artists in a programming language that was utterly symbolic, and lacking in visual sophistication. I yearned for a programming language that had the same visual clarity that graphic user interfaces had.

A prototype "pixel editor" programming system where the pixels on the screen hold the full state of the system, created during Kim's internship at Xerox PARC in the early 1980s.
