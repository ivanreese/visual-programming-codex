* [Drawing Dynamic Visualizations](https://vimeo.com/66085662)
    * Shares an idea for a direct-manipulation programming environment.
    * [Additional notes](http://worrydream.com/DrawingDynamicVisualizationsTalkAddendum/)
* [Stop Drawing Dead Fish](https://vimeo.com/64895205)
    * A talk by [Bret Victor]() in which he demonstrates a prototype iPad app for interactively building animations, with an experience more akin to puppet theatre than traditional keyframe-and-curves computer animation.
    * The app allows building algebraic relationships using geometric equivalents, a la Tristan Needham's book [Visual Complex Analysis](http://usf.usfca.edu/vca/) or the [GeoGebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoGebra) project. This is at odds with most computer animation tools, where dynamic relationships between visual elements are expressed using algebraic equations of the elements' numeric attributes.

* Talk: [Whoa, pictures! A visual history of visual programming languages!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU1aPvvQbqk)
    * Quickly surveys some of history's more interesting VPLs, with fun commentary and a nod the handful of studied benefits and downsides.

### by [Gilad Bracha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Bracha)
* [Illiterate Programming](https://gbracha.github.io/illiterateProgramming/out/illiterateProgramming.html)
    * A blog post about literate programming that turns into a demo of the Ampleforth live-coding environment for [Newspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak_(programming_language)). Hint: the browser back button can be used to navigate "back" when interacting with the embedded Ampleforth editors.
    * "The ability to change the code of the system you are using while using it is a key property that is lacking in most systems."
    * Not directly about VPLs, but relevant due to the importance of live coding to most VPLs, and the mutual influence of Smalltalk.
    * "It's a self-eating-dog-eat-self-eating dog world"
    * Don't confuse the HopscotchIDE used by Ampleforth with the Scratch-like VPL named [Hopscotch](implementations.md#hopscotch).

* Paper: [Aesthetic Programming](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2517392_Aesthetic_Programming)
    * A fantastic paper about the synthesis of artistic aesthetics, modelling, and systems.
    * "By marrying traditional methods for computer programming with an artistic temperament, we give birth to a new phenomenon: the aesthetic program. Our work builds on visual approaches in programming as well as modeling for software, where I envision a gradual evolution from program to model. The need for the aesthetic model is strengthened with the importance of personalized, individually-tailored, models. I, and my students, have formulated the rube Project methodology around the use of 3D web-based virtual world construction of models. Initial results suggest that these models are artistic, while containing sufficient symbolism and concise metaphoric mapping as to be executable on a computer."

## Wikipedia


### ★ [Visual programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language)
* Includes a great list of VPLs.

### [Category: Visual programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Visual_programming_languages)
* Lists all the Wikipedia articles in the VPL category.

### [Deutsch limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch_limit)
* The problem with visual programming is that you can’t have more than 50 visual primitives on the screen at the same time.

### [Flow-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming)

### [List of programming languages by type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type)
* I recommend searching for languages you're interested in, seeing what sections they appear within, then looking at other languages in those sections.
